# Building a nix module for MiniMint

**Description:** MiniMint is an experimental implementation of federated e-cash written in rust. One application is anonymous "community banking", where a few community members operate the mint without any single one having full control while the wider community can use it as an anonymous Bitcoin/Lightning wallet provider.

To make deployment easier having a Nix(OS) module allowing to easily set up a federation would be useful. Nix allows to write entire system configurations as a single configuration file and to reproducibly build that system. As such it is well-suited for security-critical applications.

The project is building a nix module for MiniMint. This is related to [integration testing](ci-testing.md), so if both projects are chosen by someone they should coordinate.

**Expected Outcomes:**
* Basic understanding of federated e-cash and Bitcoin
* Nix expression that builds the project's binary outputs
* Nix module in (a fork of) nix-bitcoin that allows configuration of a MiniMint federation member/server

**Resources:**
* Federated e-cash resources:
